# Exercise Goals Overview

### **Exercise 1: Implementing a Virtual Machine**
- Create a VM in Azure with documented settings (Compute, Networking, Storage).
- Access via RDP/SSH.
- Justify configuration choices (e.g., region, VM size, network rules).
- Monitor the VM using **Azure Monitor**.

### **Exercise 2: Azure Backup**
- Back up the VM using **Azure Backup**.
- Test restoration (e.g., delete a file before restoring to verify recovery).
- Document the difference between **snapshots** (short-term state storage) and **backups** (long-term, versioned backups).

### **Exercise 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Automate VM deployment using IaC tools (e.g., Bicep, Terraform).
- Define resources like network, IP addresses, and storage as code.
- **Note**: The provided code is in Terraform, though Bicep is recommended. Terraform is still valid.
âž¤ We chose terraform


### **Exercise 6: Deploying Multiple Virtual Machines with Identical Configuration**

In this exercise, we combine the results of Exercise 2 with the ability to deploy multiple virtual machines (simultaneously).

**Task Description**

Modify the template from Exercise 3 so that the number of virtual machines to be deployed can be decided at deployment time (e.g., via a parameter).

**Implementation Details**
- Use a variable to control the number of VMs (`vm_count`)
- Each VM should have identical configuration
- All VMs should be deployed simultaneously

**Technical Note**

While the original exercise mentions Bicep loops, we've implemented this using Terraform's count parameter, which provides the same functionality for iterative resource creation.

## Ad Exercise 6
For this exercise we modified the `vm.tf` and `backup.tf` to support multiple VMs.
The `vm_count` variable is used to control the number of VMs which is set to 3 by default and can be changed at deployment time.
The variable is defined in the `variables.tf` file.

We tried to deploy 3 vms but we are only allowed to have 4 cores in our subscription.
So we settled with 2 vms for testing.
